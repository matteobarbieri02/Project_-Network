The primary goal of this analysis is to explore and understand the trade flow dynamics between countries using network data analysis techniques. The dataset comprises 1344 rows, representing trade transactions between countries, with columns for "from", "to", and "amount". The "amount" column indicates the annual value of trade transactions, both imports and exports.

This study aims to identify trade relationships and evaluate the level of economic integration between various countries based on their trade volumes. By analyzing the network structure, we can uncover key players and the overall connectivity within the global trade network. Additionally, this analysis seeks to detect significant trends and patterns in international trade flows, providing a comprehensive view of how countries interact economically on a global scale.

Combining data visualization and network analysis, this project offers valuable insights into the complexities and dynamics of global trade.
